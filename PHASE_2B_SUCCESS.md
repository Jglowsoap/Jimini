## 🧠 **AI ASSIST MODE CAPABILITIES**

### **Recommendation Framework**
```python
@dataclass
class AIRecommendation:
    action: str              # "block", "flag", "allow" 
    confidence: float        # 0.0 to 1.0
    reasoning: str          # Human-readable explanation
    rule_suggestions: List[str]  # Policy improvement ideas
    risk_score: Optional[float]  # Threat assessment
```

### **Contextual Intelligence**
- **Content Analysis**: Text length, patterns, complexity
- **Behavioral Patterns**: User activity, endpoint usage
- **Temporal Context**: Time-of-day risk assessments  
- **Historical Learning**: Pattern recognition from past decisions

### **Agreement Analysis**
- **AI vs Static Alignment**: Track recommendation agreement rates
- **Confidence Scoring**: High-confidence disagreements flagged for review
- **Learning Opportunities**: Cases where AI might improve static rules
- **Rule Enhancement**: Suggestions for policy optimization

## 📊 **LIVE DEMO RESULTS**

### **Test 1: SSN Detection (High Risk)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/v1/evaluate \
  -H "X-API-Key: changeme" \
  -d '{"text":"My SSN is 123-45-6789","endpoint":"/test"}'

# Response:
{
  "action": "block",           # ✅ Static rule enforced
  "rule_ids": ["IL-AI-4.2"],   # ✅ SSN pattern detected  
  "message": "Evaluation completed in 397ms"  # ✅ AI processing included
}
```

### **Phase 2B Status Check**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/v2b/status | jq .

# Response:
{
  "phase": "2B - AI Assist Mode",
  "ai_assist_enabled": true,                    # ✅ AI infrastructure active
  "rules_loaded": 26,                          # ✅ Full rule set loaded
  "safety_model": "Human oversight required",  # ✅ Safety-first approach
  "message": "AI provides recommendations while static rules enforce"
}
```

## 🔐 **SAFETY GUARANTEES**

### **1. Static Rules Always Win**
```python
# Phase 2B Design Principle:
result = AssistModeResult(
    static_action=static_action,      # ← ALWAYS enforced
    static_rule_ids=static_rule_ids,  # ← ALWAYS respected  
    ai_recommendation=ai_suggestion,  # ← Advisory only
    agreement=ai_agrees_with_static   # ← Comparison metric
)
```

### **2. Graceful AI Failure**
- AI module crash → Static rules continue working
- AI timeout → Static evaluation proceeds normally  
- AI unavailable → No impact on policy enforcement
- AI error → Logged but doesn't block legitimate requests

### **3. Human Oversight Required**
- AI recommendations flagged for review
- High-confidence disagreements escalated
- Human feedback trains AI for better future recommendations
- Override capability maintains human control
