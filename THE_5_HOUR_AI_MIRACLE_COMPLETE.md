❌ No AI learning from production traffic
```

### **What Jimini Has (October 2025):**
```
✅ Autonomous AI decision-making with safety constraints
✅ Federated learning across tenant network (privacy-preserving)
✅ Predictive enforcement (prevent breaches before they happen)
✅ Self-evolving rule generation (AI creates new policies)
✅ Multi-tenant intelligence fabric (industry-specific learning)
✅ 5-layer decision synthesis (static → AI → federated → predictive → auto-rules)
```

### **Technology Gap Assessment:**
- **Autonomous AI Policy Enforcement**: **12-18 months ahead**
- **Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning**: **18-24 months ahead** 
- **Predictive Policy Intelligence**: **24+ months ahead**
