- **Real-time Risk Scoring**: Immediate risk assessment for all policy evaluations
- **ML-Powered Classification**: RandomForest and IsolationForest models

#### 3. Intelligence Integration âœ…
- **Policy Evaluation Enhancement**: Risk context added to all policy decisions
- **Post-Processing Pipeline**: Risk assessment integrated into enforcement flow
- **Enhanced Response Model**: Risk data included in evaluation responses
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback logic when ML dependencies unavailable

#### 4. API Infrastructure âœ…
- **Comprehensive REST API**: 12 endpoints for risk management
- **Status Monitoring**: Engine health and model status endpoints
- **Profile Management**: CRUD operations for behavioral profiles
- **Analytics Endpoints**: Metrics, trends, and anomaly detection APIs

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Components
```
RiskScoringEngine
â”œâ”€â”€ BehaviorAnalyzer          # User/endpoint profiling
â”œâ”€â”€ HistoricalDataManager     # SQLite persistence layer
â”œâ”€â”€ ML Models                 # RandomForest + IsolationForest
â””â”€â”€ AdaptiveThresholds        # Dynamic threshold calculation
```

#### Feature Engineering (15 Features)
- Request characteristics (length, endpoint frequency, temporal)
- Historical patterns (violation rates, recent activity)
- Content analysis (sensitive terms, entropy, metadata)
- Behavioral indicators (off-hours access, anomalous patterns)

#### Risk Classification
- **6 Risk Levels**: very_low â†’ low â†’ medium â†’ high â†’ very_high â†’ critical
- **4 Behavior Patterns**: normal â†’ suspicious â†’ anomalous â†’ malicious
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Trust-based adjustment (0.1 - 0.9 range)

### Integration Points

#### Main Application Integration âœ…
```python
# Enhanced policy evaluation with risk assessment
response = evaluate_with_risk_assessment(request)
# Returns: standard response + risk_assessment data
```

#### API Endpoints Delivered âœ…
```
GET    /v1/risk/status           # Engine status & health
GET    /v1/risk/metrics          # Comprehensive analytics
GET    /v1/risk/profiles         # Behavior profile listing
GET    /v1/risk/profiles/{id}    # Individual profile details
POST   /v1/risk/assess           # Manual risk assessment
GET    /v1/risk/trends/{id}      # Trend analysis

GET    /v1/risk/assessments      # Recent assessments
POST   /v1/risk/models/retrain   # ML model management
DELETE /v1/risk/profiles/{id}    # Profile management
```

### Demonstration Results

#### Successful Validation âœ…
- **Trust Score Evolution**: Demonstrated adaptive learning (0.7 â†’ 0.71 for normal users)
- **Risk Classification**: Accurate risk level assignment (critical for violations)
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Proper pattern classification (normal vs suspicious)
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment based on trust scores

#### Performance Metrics
```
System Risk Analytics:
â”œâ”€â”€ User Profiling: Real-time behavioral analysis
