## 🧠 **AUTONOMOUS AI CAPABILITIES**

### **Decision Authority Levels**
```python
class AutonomyLevel(Enum):
    DISABLED = "disabled"           # Static rules only
    ASSIST = "assist"               # Phase 2B: AI recommends, humans decide  
    CONTROLLED = "controlled"       # Phase 2C: AI can FLAG/ALLOW, humans approve BLOCK
    AUTONOMOUS = "autonomous"       # AI makes all decisions within safety bounds
    FULL = "full"                   # Complete AI authority (enterprise only)
```

### **Safety Constraint Framework**
```python
@dataclass  
class SafetyConstraint:
    min_confidence_threshold: float = 0.8    # Minimum confidence for autonomous decisions
    max_block_autonomy: bool = False         # Can AI autonomously BLOCK content?
    require_human_review_for: List[str]      # Actions requiring human approval  
    max_consecutive_blocks: int = 5          # Max blocks before human review
    override_timeout_seconds: int = 300      # Time limit for human override
    audit_all_decisions: bool = True         # Log every AI decision
```
