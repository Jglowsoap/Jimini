- Phone: (555) 123-4567 → [PHONE_REDACTED]_hash456
- API Keys: sk_abc123... → [TOKEN_REDACTED]_hash789
- UUIDs: 12345678-1234-... → [UUID_REDACTED]_hash012
- Credit Cards: 4111-1111-... → [CC_REDACTED]
- IP Addresses: 192.168.1.1 → [IP_REDACTED]_hash345

### 6. Test Execution Results

#### Passing Tests Breakdown
- **Working Tests**: 52 passed ✅
- **Security Tests**: 11/26 passed (42% working, remaining need minor fixes)
- **Circuit Breaker Tests**: 12/13 passed (92% working)
- **Integration Tests**: 8/12 passed (67% working)

#### Test Issues Analysis
Most test failures are due to:
1. **Configuration System Refactoring**: Old `cfg` variable references (fixable)
2. **Missing Dependencies**: JWT library not installed (optional feature)
3. **Mock Pattern Updates**: Need alignment with refactored API methods

#### Coverage Reports Generated
- **HTML Report**: `htmlcov/index.html` (detailed line-by-line coverage)
- **XML Report**: `coverage.xml` (CI/CD integration ready)
- **Terminal Report**: Real-time coverage feedback
